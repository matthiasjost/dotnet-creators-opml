Automatically collected RSS feed URLs from the dotnet-content-creators list

## Introduction

It has been a while since I started the dotnet-content-creators list on GitHub. The list grew over time, and many people added their favourite .NET content creators. Over time a list of the most loved English .NET content creators has formed.

Since a lot of people still use RSS readers these days. There are some excellent web-based options out there. I decided I wanted to share an OPML file with you. It is a list of all RSS feeds extracted from all the dotnet-content-creators.
