# üóûÔ∏è dotnet-creators-opml

Automatically collected RSS feed URLs from the dotnet-content-creators list

## Introduction

It has been a while since I started the dotnet-content-creators list on GitHub. The list grew over time, and many people added their favourite .NET content creators. Over time a list of the most loved English .NET content creators has formed.
Since a lot of people still use RSS readers these days. I decided to share an OPML file with you. It is a list of all RSS feeds extracted from all the dotnet-content-creators. There are some excellent web-based options out there (see under Links).

## OPML File
- Raw: [OPML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthiasjost/dotnet-creators-opml/main/OPML/blog-opml.xml)

### How do I get added to this list?
All RSS or Atom feeds that are linked via link or ahref from a channel named "Blog" in the dotnet-content-creators list are added.
